This code is for the variational-quantum simulation of a XXZ spin-1/2 chain (and other variants of the Heisenberg model) on a gate-based quantum computer. 
The ansatz used for the VQE is designed as (particle) number conserving quantum circuit (NCQC). 
The justification for using a particle number conserving quantum circuit and methods of how to construct various types can be accessed in this paper:
